🃏 Memory Card Game - React

A fun and interactive memory card game built with React! The goal is to click on images without repeating any of them. Each time you click an image, the cards shuffle, making it challenging to remember which ones you’ve selected. If you click the same image twice, the game resets, and you lose!

🚀 Features

✔ Click-based Memory Game: Test your memory by clicking on images you haven’t selected before.
✔ Randomized Cards: Every time a card is clicked, all the cards shuffle.
✔ Score Tracking: The game keeps track of how many unique cards you’ve clicked.
✔ Game Over Modal: If you click the same card twice, a “Game Over” screen appears.
✔ Responsive Design: Works on all screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
